      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        The topic that I chose for this project are graphics processing unit
        (GPU). The reason why I chose my topic to be GPUs is because I find them
        very interesting, and I wanted to create a website that will allow users
        to find and compare other GPUs in the current market. The problem I want
        to solve is simplifying entry usersâ€™ confusion when choosing the right
        GPU for them. Technology can be very complicated for entry level users,
        and it can cause an information overload when someone is trying to find
        the correct hardware for their system. I want to create a web
        application that will allow the user to choose a GPU that is right for
        them based on the data that I provide. I generally believe that my web
        application will help users find the correct GPU for them, if it does
        not, worst case it will be informative for the user if they want to
        learn more about GPUs or just want to compare with other GPUs.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been previous web applications that have solved this problem.
        The most notable example is PCPartPicker. They allow the user to build
        their own custom computer, which includes all the hardware. Specifically
        for the GPU, which is what I am focusing on for this web application,
        they display all the specifications and pricing for the GPU when a user
        clicks on it.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        The app will allow the user to compare different GPUs in the market. The
        user will be able to choose the GPU that best fits their system and
        budget. The app will also provide the user with the best deals on GPUs
        in the market.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        The data will be collected from different websites that sell GPUs. The
        data will include the name of the GPU, the price, the memory, the clock
        speed, and the number of cores.
