      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        The topic that I chose for this project are graphics processing units
        (GPU). The reason why I chose my topic to be GPUs is because I find them
        very interesting, and I wanted to create a website that will allow users
        to find and compare other GPUs in the current market. The problem I want
        to solve is simplifying entry users confusion when choosing the right
        GPU for them. Technology can be very complicated for entry level users,
        and it can cause an information overload when someone is trying to find
        the correct hardware for their system. I want to create a web
        application that will allow the user to choose a GPU that is right for
        them based on the data that I provide. I generally believe that my web
        application will help users find the correct GPU for them, if it does
        not, worst case it will be informative for the user if they want to
        learn more about GPUs or just want to compare with other GPUs.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been previous web applications that have solved this problem.
        The most notable example is PCPartPicker. They allow the user to build
        their own custom computer, which includes all the hardware. Specifically
        for the GPU, which is what I am focusing on for this web application,
        they display all the specifications and pricing for the GPU when a user
        clicks on it.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        The target users of this web application are individuals who are
        interested in purchasing a graphics processing unit (GPU) for their
        computer. These users may include gamers, entry-level people who want
        basic information, and computer enthusiasts who require high-performance
        GPUs. Users will be able to compare different GPUs available in the
        market based on their specifications, pricing, and other relevant
        information. The web application will provide an interactive interface
        where users can find GPUs based on their brand and name, click on them,
        and then view detailed information about each GPU.
      </p>
      <p>
        This web application aims to simplify the process of choosing the right
        GPU for users by providing them with comprehensive and easily accessible
        information. The web application will offer a centralized platform where
        users can find all the necessary details about different GPUs in one
        place. This will help users avoid the information overload that often
        occurs when researching GPUs from multiple sources. The web application
        will enable users to make informed decisions by comparing the
        specifications, and prices of various GPUs on the market. Ultimately,
        this application will assist users in finding the GPU that best suits
        their system requirements and budget.

      <h2>Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>
        The web application will have a simple and user-friendly interface that
        will guide users through the process of finding and comparing GPUs. The
        following steps outline the walkthrough of the application:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Homepage:</strong> The user will land on the homepage of the
            web application, they will see an introduction of the web application and what the website is about.
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- The two step process -->
            <strong>GPUs:</strong> The user will click on the "GPUs" tab in the nav bar to bring them to the GPU page.
            The user can select a GPU from two different brands, Nvidia and AMD. The user can then click on the GPU they want to view based on their name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GPU Information:</strong> The user will be diplayed detailed information about the selected GPU.
            The information will include the GPU's specifications, pricing, and other relevant details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data:</strong> The data for the GPUs will be stored in a database and will be retrieved when the user selects a GPU. All the data will be collected from reliable sources,
             mainly the official websites of the GPU manufacturers.
          </li>
        </ol>
